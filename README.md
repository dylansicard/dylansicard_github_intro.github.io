#### **What is Github?**


**Github** is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It interfaces with git, which allows users to track changes made to their codebase -- starting out in web development, Github is a great place to store and share your projects. 


#### **Getting Started**
First you will need to make an account. Navigate in your browser to https://github.com/ and click "sign up" in the top right corner. Enter the requested information to proceed.
