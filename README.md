***In this guide*** I'm going to briefly walk you through how to create a github profile and create your first repository.

<br>

### **What is Github?**


**Github** is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It interfaces with git, which allows users to track changes made to their codebase -- starting out in web development, Github is a great place to store and share your projects.

### ***Getting Started***
**First** you will need to make an account. Navigate in your browser to https://github.com/ and click "sign up" in the top right corner. Enter the requested information to proceed.

**Woohoo!** That was simple, no?

<br>

### ***Creating a Repository***
**Once** you have created an account and are logged into Github, you can create a repository. From the landing page, click the plus sign in the top right corner!

From the dropdown menu, select "Create New Repository".

From here, all you have to do is give your repository a name and description, click "create repository" and *voila* -- you have your first repository.
